# Monkey Interpreter in C++

**An Interpreter for the Monkey language written in C++**

This is my translation of the book written by Thorsten Ball, Writing an interpreter in Go, but in C++ instead of Go
lang.

I started writing this in Elixir first, but I got stuck while writing the parser. Translating imperative code into
functional programming code is harder than it looks.

So, I am writing this interpreter in C++ first, and will translate this into elixir once I fully understand the
mechanics behind parsing.
